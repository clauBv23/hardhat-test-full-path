### Quick Start

Just 
- Run ``` npm install``` to download the `node_modules` folder, a siymlink to the current project should be added.

### Problem
When running ``` hardhat deploy ``` it is failing with the next error:

```Error HH306: The 'file' parameter expects a value, but none was passed.```

### Note

If you run ``` npx truffle compile``` it will works perfectly compiling the files as spected
